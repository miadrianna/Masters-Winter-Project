# Masters-Winter-Project

The folder named Arlet Spring Onset contains the statistical analysis looking at onset of spring and Bd prevalence in metamorphs for all four lakes. It also contans code to create graphs looking at this relationship also including tadpoles, as well as graphs focusing just on the prevalence of Bd throughout the years for all four lakes.


The folder named Ao Meta contains the statistical analysis looking at all the different temperature variables (average temp, min/max etc.) and Bd prevalennce in Lac Arlet as well as looking at yearly average temperature and Bd prevalence in the other three lakes. It also contains code to create graphs looking at yearly average temperature and all species and life stages for each lake are included.


The folder named Ao OW Data contains code looking at the relationship of spring onset as well as the relationship of yearly average temperature on over-wintering tadpoles for all lakes.


The folder names cor test cotains code for the test looking to see if all the different temperature variables were correlated.


The folder named infection intensity contains the code looking at the differences in infection intensity in tadpoles and metamorphs.


The folder named Proportion of dead contains code looking at the effects of climate and disease prevalence on mortality.


The folder named Arlet First Plot contains code looking for trends in temperature for all four lakes as well as code to create graphs ilustrating the average monthly temperature.


The rest of the folders (Acherito First Plot, Ansabere First Plot and Puits First Plot) do not contain any code they just hold the csv files required for the code in the folder named Arlet First Plot.
